We are conducting research on a variety of social computing and
networking topics, including strengthening democracy by examining
the influence of state-sponsored bots on social networks, exploring
the role of social context in making recommendations to groups
of mobile users, and seeking to make the Internet safer for its
users by detecting cyberbullying using machine learning.
