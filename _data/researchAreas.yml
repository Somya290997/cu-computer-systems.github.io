    - Our lab analyzes how low-level flaws in kernels, hypervisors, and cryptographic libraries move from “just a crash” to a full exploit. 
    - We formalize these exploit paths to triage vulnerability severity automatically and concentrate defenses where they matter most.
    - By examining weird machines, unintended computational behaviors hidden inside software, we uncover new attack surfaces and craft lightweight mitigations that bring memory and type-safety to production code with minimal overhead.
    - We’ve developed censorship-resistant proxy tools that maintain connectivity under challenging conditions.
