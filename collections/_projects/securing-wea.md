## Emergency Message Broadcaster and Securing LTE Emergency Alerts

Modern cell phones are required to receive and display alerts via the Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) program, under the
mandate of the Warning, Alert, and Response Act of 2006. These alerts include AMBER alerts, severe weather alerts, and
Presidential Alerts, intended to inform the public of imminent threats.
In our previous work, we showed the details of this system and developed and demonstrated the first practical spoofing attack on presidential alerts, using both commercially available hardware as well as modified open source software.

In this project, we will enhance this system to be an emergency message broadcaster such that it can effectively deliver
a text-based information to a large number of civilians without the cellular infrastructure. 
On the other hand, we propose to develop LEAST (Lightweight Emergency Alert Spoofing Tracker), a system that detects and localizes those attackers in real time, which can make significant contributions to U.S. national security by rapidly and accurately counteracting a wide range of cellular broadcast-based security attacks that can happen in the near future.
