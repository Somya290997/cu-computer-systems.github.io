## Standard Security Metric Definition for Hardware Design


The research problem this project is addressing is the lack of standardized methods to measure and simulate hardware security. This lack of support leaves the community without a way to compare security guarantees of different architectural designs. The objectives of this proposal are to develop and establish a standard method for evaluating tradeoffs between security guarantees and performance within the hardware design cycle. The proposed project will establish and promote a fundamental shift in the way computer architecture research is conducted to include security as a first-class design requirement. The PI will enable microarchitectural measurements of security to concurrently evaluate both the performance and security implications of potential computer architectures during the design stage
