## Overview 

This project seeks to detect and localize drones using novel RF-based
techniques.  Drones are increasingly flying in sensitive airspaces,
such as near airports, forest fires, jails, sporting events, and other
dangerous areas.  Thus far, this project has discovered a way to
identify a signature embedded in the drone's transmitted RF signal
that uniquely identifies that this is transmitted by a drone, and not
standard and mobile WiFi devices.  We are continuing to improve this
system, called Matthan, which was published at ACM MobiSys 2017 and
won a SIGMOBILE Research Highlights Award.  We have secured DHS
funding to pursue next-generation drone localization research.  This
work is managed by Professors Richard Han, Dan Massey and Tam Vu,
and is in collaboration with Professor Eric Frew of the Aerospace
Department.
