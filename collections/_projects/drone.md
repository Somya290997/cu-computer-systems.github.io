## Overview 

This project seeks to detect and localize drones using novel RF-based
techniques.  Drones are increasingly flying in sensitive airspaces,
such as near airports, forest fires, jails, sporting events, and other
dangerous areas.  Thus far, this project has discovered a way to identify
a signature embedded in the drone's transmitted RF signal that uniquely
identifies that this is transmitted by a drone, and not standard and mobile
WiFi devices.  We are continuing to improve this system, called Matthan,
which was published at ACM MobiSys 2017 and won a SIGMOBILE Research
Highlights Award.  We have secured DHS funding to pursue next-generation
drone localization research.
