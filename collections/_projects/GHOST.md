## GHOST

5G is emerging and is expected to soon become near-ubiquitous around the world. Hence, U.S. government organizations such as the military and State Department, as well as nongovernmental humanitarian aid organizations, and private sector enterprises should take advantage of indigenous 5G networks to eliminate the costs of installing and maintaining an alternate communications infrastructure. However, in many areas of the world, 5G networks are deployed and operated by organizations that are untrusted and potentially hostile to the U.S. In these environments, new security technologies must enable secure operations over untrusted networks. The GHOST project protects end-user devices and non-indigenous networking equipment from potential compromise through the use of Trusted Execution Environments. The GHOST project prohibits traffic analysis through two mechanisms: the use of Software Defined Credentials; and the use of anonymization techniques to obfuscate communications connections. Finally, the GHOST project obscures changes in traffic volume by maintaining a minimum level of “GHOST” traffic, and provides for pre-scripted traffic models to confuse and mislead traffic analysis.
