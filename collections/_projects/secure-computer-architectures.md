## Secure Computer Architectures

With the emergence of public cloud computing and the internet of things, modern computer architectures are inadequate to address the security and privacy concerns of users. In this work, we look for innovative solutions to secure the computer from the hardware up. By designing the computer architecture with security as a number one priority, along with performance, we can provide additional guarantees about the security and privacy of data.
