Assitant Professor Tam Vu was named a [2020 Sloan Fellow](https://sloan.org/fellowships/2020-Fellows).

The Sloan Research Fellowships are awarded annually by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation since 1955 to "provide support and recognition to early-career scientists and scholars". This program is one of the oldest of its kind in the United States (See more information on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Research_Fellowship)).
