The CU Systems Lab recently attended HotMobile 2020. Professor Eric Rozner and his student, Shazal Irshad, won the Best Poster Award
for their work "Rethinking Wireless Network Management Through Sensor-driven Contextual Analysis." Shazal presented a paper on the same subject to a lively audience.
Eric served on a Junior Faculty/Researcher Panel and also served as a Session Chair. Professor Christine Lv was TPC chair and helped organize the workshop.
