CU Systems Lab Assistant Professor Eric Rozner has received funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to study wireless network management in edge computing ecosystems. The grant, titled "CNS Core: Small: Sensor-based Wireless Network Management via Edge Computing", provides three years of support to study 
how sensor data can be used to more effectively and flexibly manage the wireless network. A second major thrust in the proposal studies how to analyze sensory data via deep learning techniques in a more efficient manner at the network edge.
