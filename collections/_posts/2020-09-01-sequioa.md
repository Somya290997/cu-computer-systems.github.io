Ali Tariq, Austin Pahl, Sharat Nimmagadda, Eric Rozner, and Siddharth Lanka recently had a paper accepted at the ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing (SoCC) 22020. The paper presents Sequioa, a new quality-of-service function scheduling and allocation framework that allows developers or administrators to easily define how serverless functions and applications should be deployed, capped, prioritized, or altered based on easily configured, flexible policies.
