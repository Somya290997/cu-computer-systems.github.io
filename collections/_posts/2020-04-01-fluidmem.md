Blake Caldwell, Sepideh Goodarzy, Youngbin Im, Sangtae Ha, Richard Han, Eric Keller, and Eric Rozner recently had a paper accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS) 2020. The paper, titled "FluidMem: Full, Flexible, and Fast Memory Disaggregation for the Cloud," presents a new approach to memory disaggregation that leverages the user-fault mechanism in Linux to achieve full memory disaggregation in software.
