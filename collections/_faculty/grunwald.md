## Research Area

I work in the area of computer systems, broadly defined. This includes
network, wireless networking, computer architecture as well as privacy
and analysis of data sets. Previously, I have been involved in high
performance computing and storage systems. I’m also interested in and
publish on technology policy, particularly Internet and wireless
policy.

## Contact

[Google](http://scholar.google.com/citations?sortby=pubdate&hl=en&user=3Ws6G2AAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) does a better job of keeping track of my publications, citations
and the like than I ever did.
