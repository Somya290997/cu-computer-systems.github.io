Dirk Grunwald is Professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder,
in the Department of Computer Science in 1989 and had been a member of
the faculty of the Department of Computer Science at the University of
Colorado since that.

Dr. Grunwald holds joint appointments in the Dept. of Electrical and
Computer Engineering and the Interdisciplinary Telecommunications
Program.

## Research Area

I work in the area of computer systems, broadly defined. This includes
network, wireless networking, computer architecture as well as privacy
and analysis of data sets. Previously, I have been involved in high
performance computing and storage systems. I’m also interested in and
publish on technology policy, particularly Internet and wireless
policy.

## Contact

[Google](http://scholar.google.com/citations?sortby=pubdate&hl=en&user=3Ws6G2AAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) does a better job of keeping track of my publications, citations
and the like than I ever did.
